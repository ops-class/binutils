Description: binutils for OS/161 cross compile
 OS/161 is a teaching operating system, that is, a simplified system used for
 teaching undergraduate operating systems classes. It is BSD-like in feel and
 has more "reality" than most other teaching OSes; while it runs on a simulator
 it has the structure and design of a larger system. These are modified
 binutils for use with OS/161.
